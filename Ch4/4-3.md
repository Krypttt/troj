# Online vs. Offline
## Online
read the tag(1 byte), and precede to determine the length of the file so as to load the bytes precisely
## Offline
read the whole source include the tag, the length, and the rest of the file

In the end, we're gonna use the online method of cource, yet doing so would add some difficulties to our testing process
To be more clear, we'll have to set both the server side and the client side ready to test the program, which would result in dragging the progress of the entire project
Thus, we'll need both the On and Off line to make our program not only compatible with socket but can be tested anytime we wish
